         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The cogitations about heavenly matters, are errour, falſehood, and lies.</p>
               <p>The wiſhes and deſires of the heart are earthly, and fleſhly. The outward behaviour is nothing elſe but a giving up of the members of the body as inſtruments of ſinne.</p>

               <p>This Divine Myſterie is brought to light by the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>The uſe whereof is to manifeſt that righteouſneſſe in CHRIST, whereby the Law is fully ſatisfied, and ſalvation attained.</p>
               <p>The remedy and the tidings of it is received only by Faith, which Faith is ſo to give credit to Gods Word, as he reſt thereon, that hee will ſave him; and is wrought by the miniſtery of the Word, revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling this mercy and truth of God: and by theſe the holy Ghoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightening him to conceive, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to believe, and ſo uniting him to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The knowledge of the former things is not ſufficient for him that will come to happineſſe:

               <p>Secondly, the Lord directeth him to enter into further conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration with himſelfe, of and about his preſent eſtate, and conſulteth what to doe in this his ex remity; and that not lightly, but ſerio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If he be not able to counſell himſelfe, hee asketh counſell of others.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, from the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation, he commeth to this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, that hee will not returne to his old waies, but in all humility
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:15946:8"/> and meekneſſe and brokenneſſe of heart, ſay with <hi>Paul;</hi> Lord what wilt thou that I doe?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, by this meanes hee commeth to an unfained deſire of forgiveneſſe, which alwaies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from a ſound hope that God will be intreated of him.</p>
               <p>This hungring after mercy, and longing after CHRIST, is very earneſt and fervent, though in ſome with more timorouſneſſe than in other.</p>
               <p>This maketh the Goſpell to be glad tidings, and the feete of them that bring it to be beautifull to him.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, with earneſt, humble, and particular confeſſion of his ſinnes, hee poureth out prayers to God for the pardon of them in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, he having found out this pearle, prizeth it as it is worth: and therefore ſelleth all that hee hath, biddeth farewell to his ſweeteſt delights for the attaining of it;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:15946:8"/> which affection is not for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but is written, as it were, with the point of a Diamond, never to be raſed out againe.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Then he commeth to apply the Goſpell to himſelfe, as before he did the Law, and ſealeth up his ſalvation in his heart, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning from thoſe gracious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which God hath made to ſuch as he is.</p>
               <p>Thus by often and deep weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth, unchangeableneſſe and perpetuity of the promiſes, he commeth at length to be ſettled in Faith; this Faith uniteth him to Chriſt, and bringeth him to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And it is wrought inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Spirit, while men obey Gods Ordinance in the hearing of the Word, the outward meanes of ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Now the markes of Faith to be ſeene in the beleever by himſelfe or others: are</p>

               <p>A naked and bare deſire of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, now and then ſtirred up in a man, is not to beleeve.</p>

               <p>Secondly, it maketh high ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it, as of a precious Faith; and valuing of it according to the worthineſſe of it: He ſeeketh wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and readily: He ſettleth his heart upon the promiſes of God.</p>

               <p>BEcauſe the children of God after they have believed, are often drawne from their hold, and cauſed to ſuſpected themſelves, and ſo fall into much feare and doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that they are none of the Lords, they muſt therefore learne to ſtrengthen themſelves thus:</p>
               <p n="1">1. They muſt know that in God there is no ſhadow of change, and therefore that it is their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to entertaine ſuch thoughts, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 77.13. For hee ought not to caſt away his confidence, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.35.</p>

It may be weake, but it ſhall never be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed; for he that is new borne can never die.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They muſt call to mind that they be yet but children, ſubject to many diſeaſes, and ſome of thoſe, ſuch as may take away ſenſe of life; which muſt move us not to diſpair, but to ſeek w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> al diligence for the cure of them: wheras if any object,</p>

               <p n="2">2.

               <p>Thus he inticeth us to ſins, not onely which by nature wee love, but even to thoſe which wee have no inclination unto; and when he hath thus faſtened upon many a man, then he laboureth to dimme his knowledge and underſtanding, that hee may lay no hold on any truth that may comfort him, or make benefit of any promiſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by outward objects and occaſions forcibly perſwading to ſinne. Now becauſe theſe things proceed rather from Sathan than from themſelves, there is no cauſe why they ſhould be diſcouraged.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they muſt call to mind that God calleth and encourageth us to truſt and believe in him; and therefore it muſt needs diſpleaſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:15946:13"/> him that they are removed from their faith, to give place to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of error. <label type="milestone">

Thus hee muſt depend upon the whole word of God: many who have hope to be ſaved doe not thus: ſome ſinnes they make no conſcience of: ſome promiſes they looke not at; by meanes whereof they are not ſo well fenced as they might be; but hold the very promiſe of ſalvation it ſelfe very weakely. This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe partly becauſe they are not taught theſe things aright: partly becauſe being taught, they do not digeſt and work them upon their conſciences. This bringeth doubting and unſetledneſſe even to good Chriſtians: therefore hee that beleeveth to be ſaved, muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve alſo that hee ſhall be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:15946:20"/> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. that hee ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive grace from God to bring forth fruits of amendment of life, and that he ſhall be inabled to caſt off his old converſation, and alſo have grace to goe through trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and deliverance from them: for aſſiſtance and bleſſing in God, he muſt depend on God his Word; this is the obedience of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.5. which if we have as a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to uphold and incourage us, it will greatly availe for the furthering of us in a godly courſe; by this we ſhall ſooner wade through doubts, and grow out of feare; whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe wee faint and feare oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and be without helpe.</p>

When men doe not thus walke in the ſtrength of God his word, it cauſeth tedious troubles in them, and indeed the offenſive lives of many, and the ſtarting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide

And this muſt every faithfull man looke for while he live.</p>
               <p>NOw for the fountaine from whence a godly life doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, it is from the heart, which therefore muſt bee purged and cleanſed.</p>
               <p>For this wee are to know, that the heart of man, before it be emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied, is a dungeon of iniquity; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Now if ſuch an heart bee the guide of our life, how monſtrous and loathſome muſt that life needs bee? of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity then the heart muſt be purged and changed.</p>
               <p>This purging of the heart is a renewing in holineſſe and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe by little and little of all true beleeuers, they being firſt delivered and freed from the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of ſinne and feare of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for then doth ſinne receive a deadly wound, and the power thereof is abated and crucified, which is ſhewed by the hatred of ſinne, and a delighting in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>Although this change bee but weake at the firſt, yet if it bee in truth, in will and deſire, it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:15946:21"/> mark of Gods election and love towards him. This grace is often dimmed and even choked in many, becauſe God doth ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and continue this gift of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſanctification, as it is nouriſhed, eſteemed, ſet by, and as men doe ſtirre it up in themſelues, by asking after it when they doe miſſe it, and provoking themſelves to pray for ſuch good affections and cannot bee ſatisfied without them; as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 43 5.103.1. Thus we ought to cheriſh and blow up the ſparkles within us, which will not ordinarily faile us, eſpecially for any long time (except in time of temptation) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it bee through our default and folly. As for the manner how this is done, wee are to know it is the proper and wonderfull worke of God by the power of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.2.

               <p>The evils alſo that concerne themſelves, are neither few nor ſmall: in aboundance of outward things, ſetting their hearts on them and delighting exceſſively even in the abuſe of them, and ioying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond meaſure in things tranſitory, which is the very pride of life.</p>

               <p>The luſts wherewith the hearts of men doe ſwarme, and are even burdened and loden, may eaſily perſwade us, that it is divine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and grace from above that muſt purge theſe and ſuch like unſavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry draffes out of them.</p>
               <p>And yet theſe and many other ſuch like are renounced as they come to bee knowne of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and reſiſted, according to the wiſdome which God hath given them; although in others they rule and raigne, and the obtaining of grace to doe this, is a ſpeciall part of Chriſtianity, <hi>Epheſians</hi> 4.22. ſo that hee that exerciſeth himſelfe in obſerving theſe his foule and ſhamefull luſts, when hee hath beene led away, and deceived by them, which of them doe moſt trouble him, and ofteſt prevaile with him, and ſo by the helpes which God hath given him, doth

               <p>Thus all Gods children doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and overcome their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked luſts, though not all in the like meaſure, yet of the weakeſt they are hated and ſtriven againſt, when they are once ſeene and perceived.

               <p n="2">2. The ſecond is the middle age in Chriſtianity, in which as young men in wreſtling, we have courage againſt our ſinfull luſts, but yet like unto them who have many foiles, wee are oftentimes cooled in our courage, though wee ſometimes prevaile, ever growing, though ſlowly.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third is childhood or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, the loweſt and the laſt, the which is principally diſcerned by an earneſt deſire of the ſincere milke of the Word, and namely, of the promiſes of forgivenes of ſins; which although ſome of theſe deare children of God cannot with full aſſurance lay hold of; yet this
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:15946:31"/> their hungring deſire after it (which cannot be ſatisfied without it) with a ſenſible feare to offend God, is a true ſigne thereof.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſort are ſuch as through long experience, and much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, with the practice of a godly life, have obtained grace to guide themſelves more conſtantly than others, and to keepe within bounds: they are much freed from this bondage, and ſeldome ſo groſſely holden under of corrupt luſts as others: which eſtate, though it be to be aimed at of all godly people, yet it is not obtained but of ſuch as have accuſtomed their minds to the heavenly courſe, and to whom good meditations and thoughts to ſhunne and avoid evill, are become a pleaſure; and are as well able to diſcerne the ſame by their underſtanding and judgement, as to have their will in good ſort at commandement to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the good and ſhun the evill. Now theſe have their mindes uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

               <p>Thus the firſt ſort are exerciſed, yet not wholly freed from evill thoughts, and vaine deſires, for <hi>Paul</hi> was not, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. and God will make them ſee their weakneſſe from time to time, eſpecially to ſubdue pride in them, and to hold them under.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort compared to young men, are neither ſo experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced in Chriſtianity as the father, nor yet utterly unacquainted ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, as the new-borne babes.</p>
               <p>Theſe are eſpecially occupied in fighting againſt temptations, and reſiſting unruly luſts, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.4. For knowing by the light of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, what corruptions they have in them, they watch their hearts diligently, they pray againſt them oft and earneſtly, they are alwaies
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:15946:32"/> in feare leſt they ſhould be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and caſting how they may avoid the occaſions of ſinne, ſo that ſinne becomes odious unto them, yet not ever over-come of them, but often unſetled and diſtempered and as often renuing the covenant with the Lord to pleaſe him better; ſometime diſcouraged, but riſe againe, glad to uſe all good helps, both publike and private, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving prevailed againſt greater cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, are earneſtly ſet againſt the ſmaller, and ſuch as ſeeme leſſe dangerous; as the idle rovings of their braine which do not directly ſo much carry them after evill, as hinder them from good, they are holden under ſome infirmities, that they may be more humble and not forget what they were in times paſt, ſo that this ſecond age and growth in Chriſtianity is a ſtriving rather betwixt feare and hope, ſorrow and joy, than a ſuperiority over unruly affections; an eſtate ſtanding in neede of counſell and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:15946:33"/> help, rather than fitted and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced to counſell, direct &amp; ſettle others: but the more ſure they be of their ſalvation, the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert they ſhould be in the battell.</p>
               <p>The third ſort compared to little Children, who hang upon the breſt and doe labour for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their Father in Chriſt, and deſire the meanes of their ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all nouriſhment, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. their thoughts are taken up in theſe things, and their keeping them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they may not offend or diſpleaſe their father; they are cheerfull while their ſmall faith is upholden, by cleaving to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; and as uncheerfull when as faith faileth, moaning, and pining if it be long wanting: where they muſt take heede of two perills.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, leſt upon pretence of ſeeking continuance of comfort, they neglect their lawfull buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; for Satan appeareth as an Angell of light.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, leſt in want of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:15946:33"/> they be driven to any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtfull or deſperate feare; for ſo the Divell appeareth as a roaring Lyon.</p>
               <p>Theſe muſt grow daily out of their childiſhneſſe, miſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

With theſe the Lord dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth moſt kindly, not ſhewing them all their corruptions at once, which were enough to diſmay them; nor how many afflictions abide them, which were like to confound them.</p>
               <p>Thus we may ſee in theſe three degrees, how for the moſt part the purged hearts of Gods children are taken up; the weakeſt of which doe farre differ from the ſecret'ſt hypocrite, which of all unrefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ours come neereſt them.</p>
               <p>THus having ſpoken of inward luſts and ſinnes of the heart, and ſhewed how they are diſliked and renounced of all the believers:

               <p>NOtwithſtanding the former Doctrine be moſt plaine for Scripture and reaſon, yet there are many that hope for ſalvation, and yet renounce not open ſinnes, and outward offences.</p>
               <p>Theſe are referred to foure ſorts.</p>
               <p>The firſt are groſſe offenders, whom every vile perſon doth ſcorne, becauſe hee doth ſee their hypocriſie by open and often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted evills, and hath Chriſtian Religion it ſelfe in meane account for their cauſe; for prophane men when they ſee any walke ſincerely indeed, &amp; without juſt cauſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, are little moved at their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, neither greatly reverence them, or take any good by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but reproach them rather; but that is becauſe they ſee ſo many, who, beſides ſome outward appearance
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:15946:35"/> of zeale, were little better in their lives than themſelves, and therfore they are hardned to thinke ſo of all the reſt; which wilfull blindneſſe and hardneſſe of heart, though it be a fearefull ſigne of God his venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to them, yet this in great part may be juſtly aſcribed to the lives of thoſe who profeſſing godlines, in their deeds deny the ſame, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5, 6. for whom it had beene better they had never made any profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at all, ſuch as <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.18.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort are ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rude and ignorant, are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther careleſſe, flattring themſelves in that groſſe and brutiſh eſtate, who have many ſpeaches alſo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to their lives, which lay open their hearts to all.</p>

               <p>The life thus led, is not the life which God requireth, neither are thoſe works which faith affordeth, ſo that howſoever God gathereth his Elect out of all theſe kinds, yet are none of them to be accounted as his, while their hearts abide ſtained with ſuch corruptions, or their lives defiled with ſuch trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery.</p>
               <p>AGainſt this that hath beene ſaid, ſome will be objecting and asking, why ſuch difference is made of men? have the godly no faults? are they without infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? are they not like unto other men in ſinning? if it be ſo, why ſhould they be ſhoaled from the others?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that as for differences of men, they are put by the Lord himſelfe, both in name, converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and reward, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.2. and 50.16. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 19. and the end of the

Where it is demanded, if they be not partakers of the ſame ſinnes that other men are? it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, but the godly are ſomewhat infected with common corruptions, living where Satan is; and further, it is poſſible they may alſo lie ſtill in the ſame loathſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for a ſeaſon; but yet ſo, as it appeareth plainly, that they were not given over like wicked men: for when they come to themſelves againe, we ſee how ſtrangely they are amazed at their offence, how they tremble to thinke what they have done, and can have no peace within themſelves till they returne home againe after they are gone out of the way, and ſo are made more vigilant and wary againſt the like another time, the which of the wicked cannot be ſaid; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the falls of the godly are but when they are ſecure and take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty

               <p>Againe, if our hearts be not thus carefully looked unto, wee ſhall not have them ready to any duty. And from hence it is, that many mens hearts are ſwarving uſually with vaine thoughts, even whiles they are in hearing and praying,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:15946:39"/> becauſe they doe not conſtantly throughout the day watch over them: for the onely way to curb our luſts, is to looke to our hearts, by it we ſhall not onely have help and furtherance to worſhip God aright, but in our common actions, affaires and buſineſſe, we ſhould ſo behave our ſelves as would be a joy unto thoſe that ſhould behold us, and an ornament and beauty to the Goſpell which wee doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe.</p>
               <p>Thus therefore wee ought to looke to our hearts in all that we doe, both keeping out evill that would enter, and purging out that which by ſtealth ſhall creep in, and not by fits onely, when the good mood taketh us (which as it is too common, ſo it is moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous) but alwaies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.2. 1 <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.16. which if wee ſhall doe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our hearts being purified and cleanſed but in part, our deſires therefore cannot be all good and pleaſing to God, but unperfect,

               <p>Where firſt, certaine rules muſt bee learned and obſerved, which becauſe they are not followed, many that would gladly live well, attaine to it in no good ſort to bring it in credit with others, but meete with many unſetlings, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, and cooling of their zeale, yea oftentimes dangerous out-ſtrayings, neither finde the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about it ſo pleaſant as toile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and tedious. Now the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall rules are theſe.</p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:15946:40"/>
               <p>Firſt, knowledge of dutie, with a delighting therein.</p>
               <p>Secondly, practiſe of that which we know; which is that living by faith, or labouring to keepe a good conſcience, ſo often commended unto us in Scripture.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, wee muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by knowledge, ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightening of the minde to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the will of God about good evill, that wee have with it ſpirituall wiſdome, to apply and and referre the ſame to the well ordering of our particular acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; that wee reſt not in ſeeing the truth only, but approve and allow of it, as that which is fit to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and guide us, but yet ſo as hee that hath moſt of this, may grow, and he that hath leaſt, may not bee diſcouraged.</p>
               <p>This knowledge muſt not bee weighed and eſteemed of us as a thing common and of no value, but loved and liked, otherwiſe no fruit will follow.</p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:15946:40"/>
               <p>For the ſecond practice, is that ſeeking to walke worthy the Lord and pleaſe him in all things, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.10. which muſt bee both inward and outward.</p>
               <p>Inward, when as in reſolution of our mindes and deſire and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of our hearts, we are prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ready to bee ſet on worke, and bee imployed in any good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to God or our brethren, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.10. <hi>Acts</hi> 11.12. this muſt bee often blowne up in us; for if this bee loſt through forgetfulneſſe, ſloth, and careleſſe negligence, or over-whelmed with ſorrow, feare, or ſuch like paſſions, or dulled and made blunt in us through lightneſſe and vanity, then are we unfit to honour God in any ſervice.</p>
               <p>Outward, when in our lives wee expreſſe and declare the ſame, by endeavouring at leaſt to pleaſe God in one commandement as well as in another, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.3.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the rules. The
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:15946:41"/> vertues which further us herein, follow.</p>
               <p>Firſt uprightneſſe, when in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, and true heart, we love, deſire, and doe any thing, eſpecially becauſe God commandeth, and for that end, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.13. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.47. Many actions otherwiſe fervent enough, for want of this ſincerity, are but froth (as were the hot enterpriſes of <hi>Iehu</hi> againſt I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters) and cauſe them who have long pleaſed themſelves therein, to cry out of their doings (though admirable to the eyes of others) to ſay they were but hypocriſie, for many are the ſtarting holes in the den of our hearts, and many waies wee can deceive our ſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers alſo by falſe pretences in good actions: we muſt therefore labour that howſoever our beſt actions are mixed with corruptions, yet wee may have the ſame reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing with the Apoſtle, that in ſingleneſſe of heart wee ſerve the Lord.</p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:15946:41"/>
               <p>The ſecond is diligence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man is ready to take all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and opportunities to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome good, and to ſhunne idleneſſe and unprofitableneſſe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5.</p>
               <p>The third is conſtancy in nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing all good deſires, and holy endeauours, untill his latter yeares bee better than the former, and ſo finiſh his courſe with ioy.</p>
               <p>By theſe two, great matters are brought to paſſe: and for want of theſe two, and through the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, ſloth, and inconſtant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetledneſſe; euen the moſt of the godly doe not finde the ſweet fruit in their life which is to bee found.</p>
               <p>Fourthly in humility and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, all our duties muſt bee pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, if wee will follow Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29. Theſe two are not particular vertues, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times onely may haue uſe, but ſuch fruits of the ſpirit as neceſſarily are required in all actions, ſo that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:15946:42"/> at no time humbleneſſe of minde and meekeneſſe of ſpirit may bee wanting. And therefore they are oft-times in the Scripture ſet down together, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Co.</hi> 3.2. and ſo urged, as doth ſhew, that although there bee many goodly gifts in a man, yet if he hath not theſe, they ſhall looſe their credit and beauty amongſt thoſe which behold them, and withhold their commoditie from him who wanteth them.</p>
               <p>By all this that hath beene ſaid, it is evident that the life of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is a continuall proceeding in the departing from evill, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devouring after duties, and a ſetled courſe in repentance, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant walking with God: not an idle and uncertaine ſtumbling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome good actions, whiles a great part of his life is neglected and not looked after. But ſome may ſay here, wee have a deſire to doe theſe things, but wee want power and ability. whereunto I anſwer that</p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:15946:42"/>
               <p>The beſt deſire is in vaine, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept wee have with it an aſſurance of God his favour, and helpe through faith; for it is faith that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercommeth all lets, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 5.4. this letteth us ſee, that he which hath ſaved us from the greateſt danger of hell, will much more ſave us from the leſſer, of being overcome of our corrupt luſts. And if any ſhall ſay, that</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe did not finde power to overcome the body of ſinne? It is evident</p>
               <p>The holy Apoſtle did not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all rebellion of the old man, to the end he might alwaies have a marke of his unworthineſſe and ſinne remayning in him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by remember, that it was of onely mercy that he was pardoned, and the grace of God that kept him from falling away from him; and that for both theſe cauſes he might bee abaſed and kept humble un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſo great grace as hee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: and laſt of all, that hee
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:15946:43"/> might from time to time finde ſweetneſſe ſtill in the forgiveneſſe of his ſinnes.</p>
               <p>But although hee was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect here as an Angell, yet was not he carryed of his luſts into groſſe iniquities, for God his grace was ſufficient for him; and ſo ſhall it be for us, if wee doe as oft and as earneſtly deſire it; for every chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in his meaſure may looke for the like grace that <hi>Paul</hi> had, even ſtrength to performe in ſome good ſort the duties which ſeeme ſo difficult and impoſſible unto him.</p>
               <p>Which is not ſo to bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as if every godly chriſtian doth feele or obtaine this (for that might diſcourage many) but to ſhew what God his children may confidently looke for, and how their eſtate may bee bettered, and their ſpirituall liberty increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. For many good people doe not know what their heavenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath provided for them, but
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:15946:43"/> onely receive ſo much light as whereby they ſee the way to his kingdome; according to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that they have of his will; thereafter they declare and ſhew it forth in their lives; but nothing as they might, or as ſome others doe.</p>
               <p>THus of the rules and vertues which helpe us to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of a godly life. Now to ſhew wherein it doth conſiſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The duties are theſe. Firſt that pertaine to God.</hi>

                  <hi>Commandement</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>For we muſt deſire to know him as his word doth reveale him unto us, in his nature, properties, and workes, wee muſt acknowledge it is allowed, and in heart yeeld and conſent unto the truth of thoſe things which wee know of him, that then we may ſafely and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:15946:44"/> beleeve in him, and cleave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Thus knowing our ſelves to be ſafe under his wings, we muſt grow to put our confidence in him: and from hence will ariſe another, even by hope to looke for that helpe which in confidence we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure our ſelues of from the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rd, and through this confidence and hope, wee muſt become patient in in aflictions, and ioyfull in every condition of life. Further, becauſe wee know all good things to flow unto us from God, therefore unto him wee lift up our hearts for the obtaining of thoſe things which we want; unto him, we render thanks for all bleſſings received, and are affected with all our hearts and ſtrength to love him more than all the world beſides, and deſire to enioy the more full fruition of his preſence, in the meane time walking before him in all reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and uprightneſſe with a holy and child-like feare as doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come us.</p>

               <p>Where is to be knowne that hee will allow of no other meanes of worſhipping him outwardly, than he hath appointed and preſcribed himſelfe in his word: As the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring of Sacraments by Miniſters lawfully called, publicke prayer, faſts, and thankſgivings, together with the cenſures of the Church. Theſe in publike. In private, there are anſwerable to theſe, as talking &amp; conferring of the word of God, in mutual inſtructing, admoniſhing exhorting, or any way elſe which is fit for edifying; in all which duties, as in many other, that are good and godly, great care muſt be

                  <hi>Commandement</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>There is alſo a further duty, that not onely in time of his worſhip, but alſo in our common and uſuall ſpeech and actions, wee declare what a worthy and reverent eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation we have of the Lord. As by ſpeaking all good of his name, word, and workes, and in our law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full callings, by ordering and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>having of our ſelves wiſely and graciouſly, that all which live with us may ſee that our religion is ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

               <p>Vnto all theſe is one more to be added, <hi>viz.</hi> that upon the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day all our workes bee laid

               <p>Here for the avoyding of that tediouſneſſe in well-doing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto our nature is prone, the Lord hath left us variety of holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, <hi>viz.</hi> all publike and private duties, more freely to bee perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med than at other times; which wiſe and mercifull regard of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, if it cannot move us to give our ſelves to practiſe this part of holineſſe, (whatſoever our excuſes bee) wee plainely ſhew, that our mindes are carnall, and that we do but favour our ſelves in worldli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or prophanenes, idleneſſe, and eaſe when wee reaſon againſt it, as being too preciſe.</p>

               <p>In particular, ſome as Superiors by civill authority as Princes, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as Magiſtrates and Miniſters, to whom inferiours both ſubiects and ſervants muſt ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in bearing their rebukes and receiving their corrections willingly and without reſiſtance, and in yeelding obedience to all their lawfull commands.</p>
               <p>And they, if they bee in higher place, are to provide that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under them may live a godly, honeſt, and quiet life. If they bee Miniſters, they are charged to be good and bountifull, iuſt and equal unto their ſervants. Some are Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours by nature, as parents, to whom children doe owe very much, as forwardnes in imbracing their wholeſome inſtructions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and obedience unto the end, the diſpoſing of their eſtate

               <p>Some by gifts, as chiefly the Miniſter, to whom double honour, reverence, and obedience is due, for his worke-ſake, for hee is not onely a teacher, but a father.</p>
               <p>Secondly the ſtrong Chriſtian, whom God hath endued with a liberall portion of knowledge, wiſdome, experience, and other heavenly graces, more than other of their brethren: theſe the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker muſt not iudge raſhly, they muſt beare with their infirmities:
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:15946:48"/> ſo thoſe that excell in any other gifts, are to bee had in honour and account for the ſame: Some by age of the gray head and ancient in yeares, who of the younger ſort are to bee had in reverence and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, neither are we to neglect our equalls, but their dignitie and worthineſſe is to bee regarded above their owne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.10. Theſe duties we owe unto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our neighbour, to which muſt bee added a care to maintaine our owne reverence and credit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, by a courſe beſeeming our holy profeſſion: now follow ſome duties towards his life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Commandement</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>Firſt for bodily life, it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that our neighbour ſuſtaine no hurt by us or any of ours, as farre as we can hinder it, neither hee nor his, ſo as his life might bee made unpleaſant, yea though hee ſhould provoke us, yet we muſt ſuffer far
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:15946:48"/> rather then bee angry in our owne cauſe, ſeeme it never ſo weighty to us, for that is no better than folly and madneſſe: nay, further, we muſt be wiſe and carefull both in words and in deeds, to cut of all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to avoyd all diſcord; yea, though it be with departing from ſome of our right, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.7. This innocencie is accompanied with meekneſſe, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and long ſuffering. Alſo, he that is harmeleſſe, is gentle, tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſoone intreated, peaceable, communicable, and fit to bee lived with: but yet beſides the not hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of men, it is further required that wee ſhould doe them good; and indeed our whole courſe ſhould be ſuch, as that wee might make eaſie as many mens burthens as wee can: to men that are in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, we muſt be pitifull and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate; as by ſhewing mercy unto diſtreſſed ſervants and ſuch like, whom we might oppreſſe, as being not able to reſiſt us; by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:15946:49"/> the ſicke, and relieving all that are in neede; and finally, wee muſt be helpefull unto all, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and maintaine their welfare, ſo farre as neceſſity ſhall require, and our ability can performe. This helpfulneſſe hath adioyned unto it mercy and tender compaſſion, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartedneſſe and goodneſſe, and ſuch like amiable and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vertues.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for the ſpirituall life of our neighbour, wee muſt give good example of life, we muſt take all occaſions of winning men to God, of confirming them that are wonne, of peace-making, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling ſuch as bee at variance, of obſerving one another, and provoking to love and good workes: and finally, of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, exhorting, admoniſhing and comforting, and ſuch like duties.</p>

               <p>After the life of our neighbour in the next place we have charge of his honeſty, or chaſtity, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Another part of righteous dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with our neighbour is, that they bee not iniured by us in their goods: ſo that where the caſe is plaine, that any thing is another mans, wee cannot ſo much as lay claime to it; but God is deſpiſed of us; but if there be a controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, then in ſome caſes we ought to forgoe ſome part of our right for peace ſake; but if the doubt doth ariſe by the ſubtilty of either par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the damage ought to fall on them from whom it came, and if it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſo difficult, that it cannot betwixt themſelves be determined, let other men of wiſdome take it in hand, or at the fartheſt, if ſuite of Law cannot bee avoided, let it be proſecuted in love. This muſt be obſerved in generall: but there are ſpeciall duties according to the divers ſtates of men; for ſome are meerely poore men, and by
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:15946:50"/> God his appointment, doe live by almes: others can in ſome ſort part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintaine themſelves, but not without the helpe of others, by borrowing of them. And the third ſort is able to lend, or to give, or to doe both.</p>
               <p n="1">1, For the firſt ſort, they know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that their poore eſtate is allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them of God, they are to live in it with contentation; which contentedneſſe, will flow from the aſſurance of the favour of God in Chriſt Ieſus; they muſt not grudge in any ſort at the aboundance of other men, but acknowledge them as the inſtruments and hand of God, whereby hee miniſtreth to their nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſities, for the which alſo they muſt be thankefull, and take encouragement from thence to live godly and obediently, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring alſo, that as much as they bee able, and their bodily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of age, blindneſſe, lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſuch other will ſuffer them, that they ſhun idleneſſe, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:15946:51"/> all evill and unprofitable paſſing the time.</p>
               <p n="2">2 For the ſecond ſort, they muſt not borrow without need, as to maintaine themſelves in play, or idleneſſe, or ſimply to make againe of it either by Vſury, or by taking more dealing into their hands, than their ability will ſerve unto; and when they have lawfully borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they muſt carefully purpoſe, and faithfully endeavour the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of that which they have borrowed at the day appointed, and that with thanks; the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry whereof, is both a ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, being a kinde of theft, and an iniurie to thoſe that have neede to borrow; for a chiefe cauſe of little lending, is evill paying.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As touching the third ſort, thoſe that are more able, they muſt regard both thoſe duties which concerne giving and lending, and alſo thoſe rules of righteous dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, which they muſt follow in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:15946:51"/> getting, increaſing and uſing their goods, They muſt give freely and cherefully for charity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake, as the neceſſity of the poore requireth, and their ability will give leave.</p>
               <p>They muſt lend alſo freely to ſuch a borrower as is before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, not onely for the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time; but if neceſſity urgently requireth for further ſpace, nay, ſometimes to the forgiving either of all, or ſome part of it. That men may be inabled to this duty, they muſt be moderate in waſtefull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences upon themſelves, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, where they need not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth any charity binde them.</p>
               <p>In ſuretie-ſhip they muſt not be raſh, neither may we bee ſo hard, but to know and approve Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, ſo farre as we are able to beare the burthen, wee may with good advice bee helpefull even in this kinde.</p>
               <p>Now as for our common dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:15946:52"/> wee muſt firſt ſee that our calling be lawfull, then that wee deale lawfully in every part of it, that righteouſneſſe may be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by us, in buying and ſelling, hireing and letting, and in partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, &amp;c. Care muſt be had, that one party alone be not regarded, but indifferency uſed (as much as may be) for the mutuall good of both: and therefore Vſury, wherein the common benefit of both is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, is altogether unlawfull.</p>
               <p>Concerning Annuities, they are of two ſorts, the one is a yeerely ſum of money for yeeres, when the ſeller hath no ſuch Annuitie, but as he hopeth to make it by his labour and commodities. The other is a certaine revenew, rent, or part of rent, which hee injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and is willing to forgoe it.</p>
               <p>The firſt kinde is full of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, much like forehand bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaines about Hoppes, Corne, &amp;c. which ſeldome ends without j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:15946:52"/> to be made, but of thoſe who are both able to beare, and willing to ſtand to the uttermoſt of the hurt which may, befall men; it is not therefore ſafe for thoſe that are wiſe and peaceable, to meddle with this firſt kind of Annuities.</p>
               <p>The ſecond kinde is not unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, howſoever it may be often abuſed on the ſellers behalfe, by fraudulent and crafty dealing on the behalfe of the buyer, when hee taketh advantage of the others ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and ſo grinding and griping him worſe than if he had tooke ten in the hundred; for the redreſſing whereof, it is to be knowne, that the buyer of ſuch an Annuitie, if it be of a rich man, ſo as there be plain-dealing, may ſafely enjoy the benefit which the other off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>reth; but if it be of a poore man, or one that is in debt, hee muſt give the uttermoſt value without ſeeking advantage; a good token whereof he ſhall ſhew, if hee be willing to releaſe him afterwards at his deſi e.</p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:15946:53"/>
               <p>Finally, that all may come by and inioy their right, truth in words, equity in deeds, and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple meaning in purpoſes and thoughts, muſt be firmely and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly retained; and where that hath not beene practiſed, full reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution is to bee made.</p>

               <p>As to the perſon and goods of our neighbour; ſo to his name alſo, there are many duties belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging.</p>
               <p>As that were ioyce in our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours credit, and ſorrow for their infirmities, to hope with patience for better things, to cover their faults through love, of whom we have hope, yet not by flattery or diſſembling, but by Chriſtian ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition and rebuke, not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray a ſecret, when it may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and without diſpleaſing of God bee kept in; for every truth is not alwayes to be uttered, though all

We are far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther required to uphold and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the good name of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, to give teſtimony alſo unto him by word and writing. And fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, it is our duty and upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart and kindneſſe, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret all ſuch ſayings and doings as may bee well taken in the beſt part, rather cenſuring our ſelves truly, than others raſhly yet not to be fooliſhly credulous, as to iudge well of them which give open te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of their badde and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane hearts.</p>

               <p>Here for avoiding of errour, wee are to know, that this god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life deſcribed, the fruits of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and the living by faith, are but ſo many ſundry manners of ſpeech wherein the Scriptures doe lay forth the life of the righteous, or a Chriſtian conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation: for the bringing forth of the fruites of amendment, or of repentance, is nothing elſe but for the perſon who is aſſured of Salvation through the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his ſinnes, to turne unto the Lord, and to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his governement, from the power of Satan, and ſinne, and in full purpoſe of heart to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be reformed from day to day more and more.</p>
               <p>A godly converſation is even the

So alſo living by faith, is no other but relying upon the word of God, with full purpoſe to bee guided by it, either by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting upon his promiſes, or obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his commandements: which life of faith, is a moſt glorious and rich prerogative: for by this wee are confident, and reſt quiet about our Salvation from time to time: by this wee walke in newneſſe of life in all the parts of it; by it wee are aſſured in our prayers to bee preſerved, to have the rage of our ſtrong luſts weakned: by this wee are delivered from many ſharpe and bitter afflictions, and have grace to beare the reſt with great meekeneſſe and patience; by it we goe thorow our callings more eaſily. And finally, wee attaine to that quiet eſtate and ſweet peace, which the carnall wiſdome of man

               <p>HAving after a ſort declared what the Chriſtians or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers life is; it followeth to ſhew ſome reaſons, why the believer ſhould leade his life thus.</p>
               <p>Firſt, there is great cauſe why this ſhould be ſought for; becauſe by this God is highly glorified: for if he bee honoured by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of a ſinner, then much more by his life afterwards. It was a great part of <hi>Salomons</hi> honour, that hee gave ſilver as ſtones, and goodly Cedars as the wilde Fig-trees: this muſt needes bee a great honour to God, when hee giveth graces and poſſeſſions, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſilver nor gold can purchaſe, and an habitation that neither Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar nor Almond-tree can make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of; this honour the Lord hath in all ages from the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward converſation of his ſervants;

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:15946:56"/> to enter into us afreſh, while wee become ſecure and improvident.</p>
               <p>This is manifeſtly to be ſeene in the example of <hi>Peter,</hi> of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of <hi>Bethel,</hi> of <hi>Iuda,</hi> who did all purpoſe well in generall, yet not fearing their frailety, nor arming themſelves againſt the ſame, they were ſoone overtaken.</p>
               <p n="3">3 This alſo may move us, that no exerciſe of Religion nor godly meanes of the beſt ſort can do them any good, who will not reſolve themſelves to come to this faithfull practice of a godly life? This is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified ſufficiently in the Iewes practice, and proved in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets complaints; experience alſo doth witneſſe the ſame; for wee ſee many frequent the exerciſes of Religion, who becauſe they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound not with themſelves, to be caſt into the mould of holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and to be faſhioned after it in their lives, doe get rather harme than good: whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers at the ſame time, uſing the

               <p>This is not ſpoken for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of any, that they ſhould give over the uſe of any good meanes, but to ſtirre us up all for to ſeeke the true fruit of them; for Gods deare children when they grow careleſſe, looſe the fruit of good exerciſe, when they waxe weary of reverent attending upon God (as all good things the fleſh doth ſoone turne to wearineſſe) and begin after the manner of men (with whom they live) to ſeeke their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull liberty ſome way, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circumſpect enough about the keeping of the beſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Men cannot now live other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than they have done, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally after this manner; ſo that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther husband nor wife, nor one neighbour with another can be merry together.</p>
               <p>As for change of eſtate, there is no cauſe why wee ſhould feare, or be unwilling to change for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: as for delights, there are none more ſweet, than thoſe which have ground in Religion: but thoſe that cannot ſtand with a godly life, let them, in the name of God, be broken off, for they may as well be ſpared as the paring of our nailes, and therefore not ſufficient to juſtle
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:15946:60"/> out a godly life, from the practice of any true Chriſtian and Believer.</p>
               <p>THe Chriſtians life being thus deſcribed; now becauſe it is upholden by meanes, it is fit to know what theſe meanes are, and how they may be uſed aright.</p>
               <p>Theſe meanes are ſuch religious exerciſes, whereby Chriſtians may be made fit to practiſe a godly life. They are partly ordinary, and partly extraordinary; and both of theſe either publike, or private. The publike, are ſuch as be uſed in our open aſſemblies: ordinarily theſe are three.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Miniſtery of the Word.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the adminiſtration of the Sacraments.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the exerciſe of prayer, with thankeſgiving and ſinging of Pſalmes.</p>
               <p>Of private, ſome are to be uſed alone by our ſelves, as watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, meditation, and the Armour of a Chriſtian, with experience.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:15946:61"/> Some are to be uſed with others, as ſociety of conference, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-exerciſes; ſome are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to both, as prayer and reading.</p>
               <p>THe firſt and principall is the Word of God, read, Preached, and heard, as the Lord preſcribeth. That this is a ſingular helpe, wee may ſee, if wee conſider the truth, authority, ſufficiency, and plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe (through the Miniſtery and tranſlations) which is in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>To ſpeake therefore nothing of the benefit which it bringeth unto the unregenerate, unto whom it is of might to convert them. The uſes are many and daily which the regenerate people of God have by it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by it they are cleared from errour and darkeneſſe, about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and manners, and are made more ſound in the knowledge of the truth, and ſee more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:15946:61"/> into the way and whole courſe of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They grow ſettled and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in their knowledge from day to day.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They are by this quickened in their drowſineſſe, cheered in their heavineſſe, called backe from their wandrings, raiſed up when they are fallen, and counſelled in their doubtfull caſes of advice.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They are by it ſettled in a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly courſe, and taught to keep well when they are well, rather than to be fickle &amp; inconſtant in good car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of themſelves, as many are. For by it, as by a Sunne that giveth light in all places, they eſpy their weakeneſſe, and how they are hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den backe when they are fallen, and which is the right way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding: By it, as by a rule, they are taught to frame all their actions.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They are brought to beſtow ſome time in pofitable reading.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They are framed ſo, as they
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:15946:62"/> become lights and examples to others: ſo that wee may boldly conclude, that the ordinary prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Word, is a ſingular meanes provided for the perfecting of Gods Elect, and for their grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Chriſtian life. And whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever liveth where there is a good order of teaching with diligence, skil, love, and plaineneſſe; if he find not this fruit by it, it is becauſe he is not attenti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and reverent in hearing, hee is not prepared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to heare, or elſe doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply unto himſelfe, nor willingly digeſt that which hee hath heard; but is ſurfeited of ſome dangerous qualities in his life, or corruptions in his heart; among which, this is a ſpeciall one among the people, that as they thinke of the perſon that teacheth, ſo they doe of his Doctrine, and not otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>AS for the Sacraments, they are helps neceſſarily adjoyned unto the former; for they doe viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:15946:62"/> confirme and ratifie that which the Word doth teach, and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant betwixt God and the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made, is moſt ſurely ſealed up and effectually on both parties by them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Lord for his part hath granted to every faithfull perſon, that he will never call his ſinnes to a reckoning, but will be his God, and love him to the end through Chriſt; for the ratifying whereof, hee hath put to his ſeale: ſo that the Sacraments muſt needs remaine effectuall to the faithfull, both for the ſtrengthening of his faith in the promiſe, and alſo for removing of all contrary doubts which through weakneſſe might ariſe. So on the other part, every believer for his owne part hath covenanted, to truſt in God alwaies, to indevour to walke before him conſcionably, in righteouſneſſe of heart and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie of hands.</p>
               <p>Now of the truth of his heart, the Sacrament is a ſigne; which he
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:15946:63"/> having received, hath openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed thereby, that he hath given and conſecrated himſelfe unto the Lord, and is now no more his owne to live as his carnall will would deſire; ſo that either the preſent receiving, or the freſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of this, doth ſpurre him forwards to keepe his covenant, and incourage him againſt tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, weariſomneſſe, and all hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances, eſpecially believing, that ſtrength in meaſure ſhall be given him of God to performe that which he hath promiſed and ſealed. By all which we may ſee, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Sacraments be unto the unbelievers, even as a myſterie or hidden thing, yet the believer ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been ſoundly inſtructed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, beholdeth much, both for the ſtrengthening of his faith, and his incouragement in a godly life.</p>
               <p>Firſt, this may be ſeene particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the two Sacraments: for the faithfull Chriſtian which hath beene baptiſed, as he by his ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:15946:63"/> into Chriſt, is one with him; and therefore while Chriſt liveth, muſt live alſo: ſo he having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by prepared union and fellowſhip with him, doth draw ſtrength and grace from him, even as the branch from the Vine, <hi>viz.</hi> The power of his death for the mortifying of ſin, and the vertue of his reſurrection in raiſing him up to newneſſe of life. So that Baptiſme throughout his life, muſt needs be a forcible meanes to helpe him forward in a Chriſtian courſe, as oft as hee doth duly conſider it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Likewiſe that the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is an excellent helpe, we may ſee in three ſpecialties: <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. In the preparation to it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the preſent uſe of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the time which followeth after.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt conſiſteth in the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that every man ought to take of himſelfe, concerning his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge both generall and particular, his faith in Gods promiſes, his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:15946:64"/> indevour for the removing and ſubduing of all ſinne, and for readineſſe in any duty, his love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all men: and laſtly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his hungring after this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and the benefit which God offereth by it.</p>
               <p>Theſe properties if hee finde to be in himſelfe, hee is a fit and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come gueſt to the Lords Table; but if through ſloth, forgetfulneſſe, darkneſſe, corruption and weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, theſe graces be weakned, dimmed, and decayed, he may not raſhly put forth himſelfe in that caſe, but ſpeedily ſeeke to recover himſelfe againe, by ſearching the ground and ſerious renewing of his faith and repentance. Which things being ſo; it cannot be but that this kind of preparation muſt be a ſingular helpe to thoſe that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe at the Supper it ſelfe, where hee may, and ought to meditate on the dainties of the banquet, and the love of him that
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:15946:64"/> ordained it; on the Communion he hath with Chriſt, and his graces; and on the outward ſignes what they aſſure him of; and on the Word preached, which ſheweth him all this. When as by the apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe things he commeth to be comforted and made glad, or rather to be revived and quickned in his ſoule with the ſpirituall dainties which by true faith hee feedeth upon; how can hee but praiſe and bleſſe the author of this banquet? how can he but be much heartned &amp; ſet forward in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian courſe? It is alſo of the ſame force after the receiving of it, (where right uſe is made of it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods appointment) through the remembrance and due conſideration of the kindneſſe of God therein offered and reaped, eaſily to carry on the ſervant of God in a fervent deſire of all well doing, be heartened and ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thereunto, even as a man well refreſhed with meat is made ſtrong
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:15946:65"/> to labour: ſo that hee which is not made more able to conquer his luſts, and weaken the ſtrength of ſinne, and is not more heartened to the life of godlineſſe by theſe Sacraments, doth abuſe them, and ſeeth not Gods purpoſe in ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them.</p>
               <p>THe publike prayers ſolemnly offered to God in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and praiſing of him with Pſalmes, is another of theſe publike helpes: for when beſides our owne private ſupplications and thankeſgiving, we have by the Lord himſelfe appointed theſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in publike, and that in ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne a manner, the whole aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conſenting with us in the ſame, and God preſent among us to aſſiſt us, as he will, becauſe the very or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God doth promiſe a bleſſing thereto, as oft as wee are partakers of them, ſo that if wee come with reverence, feeling our wants, earneſtly deſiring and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:15946:65"/> to obtaine the things we pray for, together with true repentance, wee ſhall receive fruit of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, even that good refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereby in private we ſhall be more cheerefully bent to ſerve him.</p>
               <p>So that neither any prejudicate opinion concerning the Miniſters perſon (though hee be dumbe, or otherwiſe offenſive) nor yet any raſh judgement of reading a ſet forme of prayer, or any thing of the like kinde, ought to hinder us from theſe publike duties; neither ought the private helpes to be neglected of us upon any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, without the which the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like are but cold.</p>
               <p>THe firſt private help is watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe: which is a carefull obſerving of our hearts, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.25. Diligent looking to our waies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.1. that they may be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and acceptable to God. The neceſſity of this help may appeare
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:15946:66"/> many waies, for without this, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety is loſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.7. and the force of our prayers abated, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.1. and for want of this (as experience ſheweth) many Chriſtians are not acquainted with a well ordered and ſettled courſe, but out and in, off and on, never ſtaied; and becauſe of the contrary careleſneſſe and ſecurity, many, not evill men are plunged into ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry noyſome temptations, finde many wounds in their ſoules, and want many comforts in their lives; ſo that ſome are as untruſty as <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hazi,</hi> ſome as haſty, furious, and unſociable as <hi>Nabal</hi> was.</p>
               <p>The manner of this watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is ſet downe by the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. to be in all things, and at all times, and by all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in all places, with all perſons, and that conſtantly, ſo long as wee be in danger of temptation, <hi>Marke</hi> 13.33.</p>
               <p>All of us therefore that deſire <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o walke with God in peace, muſt go
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:15946:66"/> about this duty to purpoſe, and ſet our minds and delight upon it; our evill luſts, wherewith wee be full fraught, doe carry us head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into ſundry iniquities, in ſo much that wee can goe about no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but we may feele (if we can diſcerne) that ſome one or other of them is in our way to hurt us, and at hand to moleſt and diſquiet us: if we be occupied in ſpirituall duties, wee have ſhame and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie on the one ſide to hinder us; dulneſſe, wearineſſe, untoward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp;c. on the other ſide to breake us off. In things lawfull, we are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure &amp; careleſſe what the maner or end be: in evill, we have eyes open to ſee the ſeeming pleaſure or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit they promiſe, and reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate the danger; but we have no eares to receive the ſtrongeſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions that can be brought. We therefore muſt be kilfull to know theſe diſordered luſts diligent to eſpy, prevent, and avoid them; wee muſt abſtaine and weane our
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:15946:67"/> ſelves from that which our hearts would naturally deſire moſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.10. wee muſt not dally with the baits of ſinnes, wee muſt not be ſo bold as to venture upon all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, to fall into any talke, or to take liberty in any deſires without reſpect. And unto this care wee muſt adde prayer, as that which doth quicken and put life to it, ſo that it may be continued with much cheerefulneſſe and little te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>It is further alſo to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that becauſe the ſervants of God have ſome ſpeciall infirmities wherewith they finde themſelves more troubled than with any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they muſt be moſt ſuſpicious of, and vigilant againſt them: and where they ſee Satan moſt likely to winde in himſelfe, there they muſt carry a more narrow and ſtreight eye, avoiding the leaſt occaſion that tends that way, and beſtowing more time and labour in the roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of theſe corruptions, from
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:15946:67"/> the which moſt danger may be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. As in troubles we muſt watch againſt impatience; in proſperity, againſt wantonneſſe, becauſe theſe are likeſt to enſue; and when wee have broke out of our conſtant courſe a little, and that our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience begins to checke us, then wee muſt tremble to thinke of it, returne ſpeedily againe, and wee muſt feare after, leſt wee ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend.</p>
               <p>This may ſeeme unto many to be too ſtrict, that our hearts may not range where they liſt, nor our delights be faſtened where wee pleaſe, but that all powers of our minds and members of our bodies muſt be holden within compaſſe. But unto thoſe who are acquainted with it, and ſee what ſafe peace, and ſweet joy it bringeth to their life, it is no tedious bondage, but a ſpirituall and heavenly liberty. On the other ſide, thoſe that will not be perſwaded to entertaine it, they muſt looke to live deſtitute of a

               <p>The ſecond private help is <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation;</hi> and that is when we doe of purpoſe ſeparate our ſelves from all other things, and conſider as we are able, and thinke of ſome points of inſtruction neceſſary to leade us forward to the kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the better ſtrengthening us againſt the Divell, and this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent evill World; and to the well-ordering of our lives. This hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly communion with God and our ſelves, is that which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers called their <hi>Soliloquies:</hi> which muſt be diſtinguiſhed from the ordinary thinking of good things, and pondring of words and actions, which yet in the Scripture is called meditation, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.8 <hi>Pſal</hi> 119.97. for that ought never
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:15946:68"/> to be wanting, being a part of watchfulneſſe, and is exerciſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with prayer; but this is more ſolemne, when a man of ſet purpoſe doth ſeparate himſelfe from other buſineſſe, to ſolace himſelfe in theſe holy and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoughts.</p>
               <p>The matter of this our medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be on any part of Gods Word, of God himſelfe, on his workes of mercy and judgement, of our owne eſtate, of the vanity and miſery of this world, and of the manifold privileges which wee with the reſt of Gods children en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy: but eſpecially of thoſe things which wee have moſt eſpeciall neede of.</p>
               <p>The great and neceſſary uſe of this duty, may well appeare even in the heart of good Chriſtians, in which there is much naughtineſſe; ſo many rebellions, and loathſome filthineſſe, that it maketh ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire of r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>forming it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ceaſe to endeav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ur it;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:15946:69"/> yet if ſuch noiſome poiſons be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to lurk and remaine in them, they will not only as ſower weeds choake the plants of grace within us, but alſo grow up themſelves, and bring forth moſt noiſome and dangerous fruit, as by wofull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience men feele and try. Now for the weeding of theſe out of the ground of our hearts, there is no meanes ſo availeable, as the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering oft, and deepe meditating: <hi>viz.</hi> to finde out what ſwarmes of them doe lodge in our hearts; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to bring them into a vile ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, to be weary and aſhamed of them, and ſo to entertaine better in their roome: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by the Word wee know our corruption, by conference we revive the remembrance of them, and by reading we doe both; yet all this will be but of ſmall force, except they be joyned &amp; ſeaſoned with meditation. For our hearts are ſo deceitfull, that if once wee can but commend that which is
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:15946:69"/> good, and ſpeake againſt evill, we are ready to thinke that our eſtate is right marvellous good; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as yet, if there be not in the heart a hatred of the one, and love of the other, we doe but deceive our ſelves. Now, when wee doe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten gage theſe hearts of ours, and ſift our thoughts, and deale truly (in accuſing or excuſing) as wee love our ſoules; though wee finde ſinne to ſit neere and faſt glued, yet by Gods aſſiſtance and bleſſing we ſhall breake off and chaſe away theſe curſed ſwarmes of prophane thoughts and deſires; we ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come better armed againſt them afterwards, and our heart being thus mollified, and relenting, wee ſhall furniſh them more graciouſly with holy thoughts, and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſires, and draw them into more neere and heavenly commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with our God; taking heede of the ſugred baites of earthly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and tranſitory pleaſures of this world. In ſumme, the fruit and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:15946:70"/> benefit which by our meditation and private prayer wee reape, is ſo great (the Spirit of God changing our hearts thereby from their dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly courſe and cuſtome more and more, and bringing the heavenly life into more liking with us, and making it more eaſie and ſweete which with the men of this world is ſo irkeſome and unſavoury) that none can expreſſe and conceive it, but hee which hath felt the ſame. Therefore it is that the men of God, who are moſt commended for their piety, both of old, as <hi>Moſes, David, Paul,</hi> &amp;c. and in our times alſo, are moſt taken up of this exerciſe; and others that are ſtrangers to it, though they be good Chriſtians, want much fruit which by it they may reape.</p>
               <p>The lets which are enemies to this duty, they are of two ſorts; for either they are ſuch which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der men altogether from going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, or elſe ſuch as keepe them from taking any good thereby
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:15946:70"/> when they enter into it. Of the former ſort there are three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is when a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an knowing this duty to be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of him, goeth about it but hee is ſo empty and barren that he hath no matter to beſtow the time and his cogitations about. Now for the remedy of this, there ſhall be rules and examples ſet downe hereafter: but in generall, it ſhall be expedient for him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound unto this his meditation theſe foure things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, of his unworthineſſe, vileneſſe, ſinnes and corruptions</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, the greatneſſe of Gods bounty in his deliverance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, how he may be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded throughout that preſent day, according to the rules of direction, eſpecially in the hardeſt points.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Fourthly, of the ſeverall parts of the Chriſtian armor which God hath appointed for his ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond impediment of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:15946:71"/> this ſort, is an unfit mind unto ſpirituall and heavenly duties, through ſome unſetledneſſe, ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, or other corruptions.</p>
               <p>Now the beſt remedy for ſuch a one, is to meditate of his preſent unfitneſſe, looſeneſſe of heart, and earthly-mindedneſſe to count it an heavie burden to accuſe his heart, and ſo to bring it to relenting, by conſidering how farre off it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently from that mildneſſe, humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, heavenlineſſe, and readinſſe unto duties which have beene in him at ſome other times: but let no man give any liberty in any ſort to his evill heart, when it is turned away from cheerefulneſſe and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe in any part of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to goe forward therein, for that were to bring him to utter bondage.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third let is, want of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity by reaſon of neceſſary buſineſſe taking up the time; or for want of convenient place, as it falleth out to ſea-men, and thoſe
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:15946:71"/> that have ſmall and poore houſes: concerning which, it is not to be denied but that there may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time fall out ſuch buſineſſe as may excuſe us in the omiſſion of this duty; and this muſt be remembred that the ordinary duties of our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings muſt not put this dutie out of place, for if they doe, it is through unskilfulnſſe, or untowardneſſe of them who commit this fault: one of them is appointed of God to goe with the other, and both of them ſtand together in upholding of their inward peace. If any man be rich, hee hath the leſſe cauſe to be holden from it by worldly care; if they be poore, they have the more need of it to moderate their care, that it exceed not, nor carry them to unbeliefe: but if any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, or pretend extraordinary bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, they muſt take heede that they ſeeke not cloakes for their ſloth: yet if any have neceſſary lets indeed, hereby they ſhall appeare to be fruitleſſe if at any time God
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:15946:72"/> be remembred ſome other way as ſhall be moſt convenient, and this duty ſupplyed when the hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is paſt.</p>
               <p>Of the ſecond ſort of lets which may be called abuſes, there be eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially two.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is to uſe it ſleightly, and ſo to make a ceremony of it: the remedy whereof is to hold our mindes with taking delight in it; for this, and all other good helpes will be unſavoury unto us, except wee ſhould faſten a love and liking on them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond is when although we be deſirous to uſe meditation, yet our heads are ſo full of trifling and wandring fantaſies, or worldly matters, that we cannot mind hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things: the cauſe of this is the letting looſe of our hearts all the day diſorderly, without wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching over them, or keeping them within an holy compaſſe. For the remedying of it, wee muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore carefully ſet our ſelves againſt
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:15946:72"/> the corruptions of our hearts, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to dry up thoſe ſwimming toies with the flame of heavenly and fervent affections; wee muſt tie up our looſe hearts throughout the day from their deadly cuſtome of ranging after vaine, fond, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull thoughts, dreames and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights; this whoſoever doth or not at all, or ſeldome, or coldly, they loſe a great p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rt of thoſe privileges and liberties, which God hath provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for them in their Pilgrim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>The Rules of direction in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating be theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hee who deſireth to have helpe by meditation, muſt weigh how ſlippery, fickle, and wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his heart is infinite waies to his exceeding hurt; and that hee muſt of neceſſity appoint ſome ſet time to check, reclaime, and weane it from the ſame, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 17.9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.17.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hee muſt watch over his
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:15946:73"/> heart (having beene ſo often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by it through his whole life) and have it in ſuſpition, that ſo it may be more fit to be drawne to ſuch heavenly exerciſes, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto the ſame.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This being obſerved, let him draw matter of meditation and prayer from his owne wants and infirmities, from Gods benefits, from the changes and mortality of this life, &amp;c. eſpecially of that which is moſt availeable for this preſent.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If hee cannot doe that, let him reade ſome part of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or other booke fit to ſeaſon and well affect his minde, that ſo his mind may be quickened to the performance of this duty.</p>
               <p>Particular meditation concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning duties to be practiſed.</p>
               <p>No man ſhall be fit to governe himſelfe aright before men, if hee doe not uſually acquaint himſelfe with, and frame himſelfe after that Chriſtian courſe, firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:15946:73"/> God. Yet no man muſt reſt in private exerciſes of Religion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a wel-ordered life before men. Every part of our calling muſt be ſo carryed, as wee may have peace thereby; if a man be fallen, hee muſt not lie ſtill, <hi>Ier.</hi> 8.6. but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne unto God, though with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.8. the breach muſt be made up in our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; which if wee doe, God is not farre off, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.7.10.12.22.</p>
               <p>If wee rejoyce onely in proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, it is a ſigne that Gods bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, not his favour, makes us mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. It is a good thing to rejoyce in the Sabbaths, and in the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints; yet wee may not reſt there, but in this, that God is our portion alwaies, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 110.57. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16.</p>
               <p>In croſſes wee muſt uſe great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, otherwiſe wee ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettled by them; to this end wee muſt prepare and looke for trouble before it come, and in it we muſt meditate of the beſt privilege that
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:15946:74"/> God hath given unto us, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.</p>
               <p>Wee ſeldome keepe unlawfull commodities, or rejoyce too much in lawfull, but the Lord doth croſſe us in them. The moſt vexations in our life become annoyances un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us through our owne default; in that, wee either prevent them not when wee may, or beare them not as we ought, or make not uſe of them as wee might doe. When matters of more importancee than our Salvation is come in place, let us be occupied in them with more fervency than in that: but not before. The practice of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is a rich and gainfull trade, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.14. but if it be not well followed, it will bring no great profit. To haue a willing minde to be well occupied, and matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which wee may, and time to beſtow therein, and freedome from lets therefrom, is an eſtate much to be made of; and yet for the moſt part, they which have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:15946:74"/> all outward incouragements, cannot tell what to do with them.</p>
               <p>Whatſoever meaſure of graces wee have gotten, yet it is certaine, that God hath much more for us than we can thinke of, if thoſe be the matters which wee have in greateſt price; but being ſet light by, and the meanes neglected which preſerve them, they die. That is a good eſtate, when wee have not onely joy in heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things at the firſt hearing of them, but increaſing in joy, as our knowledge and experience increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth; and when wee are not onely delighted in theſe preſent duties of Gods ſervice, but alſo as joyfull to thinke of them which are to come, accounting that the more they be, the better they are. The more ſure thou art of God his favour by faith, the more humble thou art alſo, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.27.</p>
               <p>They are worthy of great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment who ſet light by the plenty of that grace, the crummes

               <p>Wee may not aſſigne the Lord, in what place, ſtate, condition, or in what company wee would live, but as ſtrangers wait on him, even as the hand-maid on her Miſtreſſe, for whatſoever hee will allow us: wee are ready moſt commonly to be called away by death, before we be fit, or have learned how to live. Looke what care, conſcience, zeale, love, and reverence, eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of good things, thou haddeſt when firſt thou embraced'ſt the Goſpell; the ſame at leaſt retaine, and be ſure thou keepeſt ſtill after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. The more knowledge that
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:15946:75"/> thou haſt, take heed thou beeſt not more ſecure; for thus it is with many at this day, who therefore doe ſmart for it.</p>
               <p>Wee ſhall not enjoy the grace which wee had at the firſt, except wee be carefull now to keepe it, as wee were then to come by it.</p>
               <p>Keep downe carnall liberty, and the ſpirituall liberty ſhall be great, and reſt on God, and it ſhall make thee overcome the hardeſt things.</p>
               <p>Wee muſt remember to ſerve and walke with God by daies, not by weekes and moneths onely, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.12.</p>
               <p>As Husband-men wait for their fruits, ſo ſhould we for that which wee pray and hope for; and that would make us joyfull when wee obtaine it.</p>
               <p>If we can rejoyce at the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a ſinner, then are we Chriſt his friends, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.6.</p>
               <p>It is a folly, yea, a madneſſe, to be heavie to the death for any earthly thing, when yet a man
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:15946:76"/> deſireth nothing more than life</p>
               <p>All our life ought to be a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for a good end, and a keeping away of wo which commeth by ſinne.</p>
               <p>The fleſh would faine pleaſe it ſelfe in ſome unlawfull liberties, when we have pleaſed God in ſome duties; but a wiſe man will keepe well when hee is well. The more grace we perceive in any man, and conſtancie, the more hee is like to God, the better wee ought to love him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.23. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.4.</p>
               <p>Where there is wilfulneſſe in ſinning, there is great difficulty in relenting, and alſo no power nor boldneſſe in believing. Many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning well in godlineſſe have fainted and quailed, or beene juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproached before their end, that others may the more feare their owne weakneſſe: where new knowledge is not ſought, there is the leſſe favour in the uſe of the old; and when men make not good uſe of the old, the ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:15946:76"/> of the new is but noveltie.</p>
               <p>Men having experience of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans malice and continuall dogging of them to doe evill, it ſhould teach them to truſt better in their armour, and leſſe to themſelves.</p>
               <p>Where we ſuſpect that corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions grow, if wee goe not about to pull them out, and plucke them up, they will be too deeply faſtned in a ſhort time.</p>
               <p>Though man pray and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, and keepe a better courſe in his life than ſome doe, yet if hee doe it but ſleightly, that the fleſh prevaileth much in hindering the well-performing of it, all will ſoone come to nought; it may be perceived in the ſway it beareth in other parts of the life, and then let it be ſpeedily amended.</p>
               <p>It is good ſo to taſte our ſelves with duties, one or other, at all times, and in all places, that ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wee may cut off occaſions of much ſinne.</p>
               <p>Let no ſinne be ſleightly paſſed
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:15946:77"/> over or omitted, for when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to remembrance in trouble, it will be an heavie burden, and pinch us to the heart.</p>
               <p>THe third private helpe is the armour of a Chriſtian: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which foure points are fit to be knowne.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, what it is, and which be the chiefe parts of it.</p>
               <p>It is that ſpirituall furniture of the gifts and graces of the holy Ghoſt, by which God doth deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his from all adverſary power, and bring them to the obedience of his will, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. the parts are ſet downe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.14.</p>

               <p>To be deſtitute of this ſhield of faith, is the undoubted way either to deſpaire utterly, or elſe in deadly preſumption and ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to drowne our ſelves in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p>To leave off the breſt-plate of righteouſneſſe, is to expoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into the danger of every temptation; for hee that doth not from time to time afreſh indent with his heart againſt all unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, he may look to be carried into thoſe unlawfull actions which

               <p>So that wee may well affirme, without this compleate armour of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:15946:79"/> God, that the Chriſtian life cannot be continued.</p>
               <p>THe third point is, how this Armour ſhould be put on.

               <p>What then meaneth the Apoſtle when he biddeth us put on this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour? His meaning is, that wee ſhould not have it as men in the time of peace have their bodily armour hanging by them, unfit f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:15946:80"/> ſtrength is by our armour.</p>
               <p>Now to put on, and alſo to keepe on, and to have the feeling of every part of this armour, (faith againſt diſtruſt, hope againſt fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, uprightneſſe againſt hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie; knowledge againſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſſe of ſin; righteouſneſſe, againſt all kinde of iniquity, and the preparation of the Goſpell of peace, againſt croſſes) to have, I ſay, this armour in a readineſſe, we muſt uſe continuall watching, hearty prayer, and frequent medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation about them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.4.</p>
               <p>Here is to be obſerved, that the ſword of the Spirit hath two bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, <hi>viz.</hi> that knowledge which wee get out of the letter of the Scripture onely, and ſo have it but by rule: and the knowledge which wee learne by proofe and triall for the bettering of us: for as in all trades and ſciences there is great difference betwixt the experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall knowledge of them, and bare or naked skill of them; ſo is
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:15946:80"/> there great diſtance betwixt one that hath onely attained ſo much knowledge as will enable him to give account of his faith, and him who hath had the proofe of this knowledge, how it hath beene ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall in him. Hee conſidereth, obſerveth, and applieth the things which he heareth, ſeeth, and doth, to his owne uſe: and by things paſt thus duly regarded, hee lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and getteth wiſdome to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe and guide him for the preſent, and for the time to come.</p>
               <p>This is experience, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth us wiſe in all things that are profitable to godlineſſe and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life.</p>
               <p>The obſervation of the reward of evill will make us avoyd it; and experience of the fruit of a godly life, is the beſt meane to continue it: our owne triall how affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>NOw to come to thoſe helpes, either by our ſelves alone, or others alſo (for the other kinde ſhall have another place) theſe are prayer and reading. Firſt of Praier.</p>

               <p>In this direction, there are to be obſerved three things, and three motives unto them.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p>To the right practice of this, there are foure things required.</p>

               <p>The laſt part of Prayer, is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; it is that part of Prayer, wherein wee earneſtly poure out our ſutes unto God, in contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of heart, according to his will, with comfortable hope, that through Chriſt we ſhall be heard, and therefore forſaking the ſinne which might hinder our ſute.</p>

               <p>HItherto of ordinary helpes, extraordinary are eſpecally two.</p>

               <p>The firſt is, when in ſome rare and unlooked for deliverance out of deſperate danger, wee doe in moſt fervent manner yeeld praiſe to God for the ſame, and rejoyce heartily in the remembrance and confideration of it, tying our ſelves in a renewing of our holy covenant more firmely to the Lord: and teſtifying both theſe by ſignes and unfained good will to our brethren.

               <p>Now if we weigh the force and uſe of theſe exerciſes, how the one raiſeth up a joyfull recording of God his wonderfull kindneſſe; the other bringeth us low for our owne vileneſſe, more eſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred. Both of them doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly draw our hearts to more love and obedience to God; wee muſt needs confeſſe them to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall meanes for the ſetting us forward in a godly life.</p>
               <p>NOw that a believer is defined, the godly life deſcribed, and the helpes thereunto adjoyned: It remaineth in the next place, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the weake Chriſtian in the right uſe and applying of the meanes.

               <p n="1">1 Firſt therefore to declare that the believer muſt have direction for his life every day out of Gods Word, it is manifeſtly proved out of theſe places of Scripture, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17.4.2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.75.</p>

               <p n="6">6 That the very ten Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, it joyning duties towards himſelfe generally on ſixe daies in three commandements, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on the ſeventh in the fourth, but towards men on all daies, doe lead us to this daily direction.</p>

               <p>Therefore as a man that hath a long journey to travell, will not count this ſufficient direction to goe on Eſtward, or Weſtward, or ſuch generall rules, but will take a particular note of Townes and paſſages: ſo ought wee to learne wiſdome, that having a great pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage to paſſe, wee content not our ſelves with generalls, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thoſe certaine particulars, which may helpe us forward in the kingdome of heaven.</p>

               <p n="1">1. That it is called an endevour only, becauſe perfection is neither required of God, nor to be looked for of the beſt Chriſtians.

               <p>Theſe are all neceſſary, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we can never be ſafe, we can never taſte of true joy. But here two extremities are to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided in conceiving of them. One, that wee thinke it not ſufficient to regard theſe duties, ſome one time in the day; for wee muſt have this
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:15946:91"/> preſent with us, and our hearts ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with them thorowout the day. The other is, that wee doe not take occaſion from hence to ſhake off our callings, or neglect any part of them; for in our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and meaneſt workes, we may and muſt ſerve God, by doing them in faith, not for carnall reſpects on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and avoiding the common ſins that prophane ones joyne with them.</p>
               <p>COncerning outward actions, no certaine rules can be given in particular, becauſe they are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable and infinite; yet ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward duties there are, although not neceſſary to be done daily, yet commonly to be obſerved, very profitable and helpfull to live well and happily, by ſettling us in the practice of a daily direction; ſuch are theſe that follow.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That wee walke with God, that is, that as ſoone as wee have broken off our ſleepe, wee ſet God before our eyes, and our hearts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>This accuſtoming our ſelves to good thoughts, at our firſt awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, by ſetting our hearts upon ſome holy and heavenly things, would be a good entrance to the well ſpending of the day, and a preventing of ſundry evills.</p>

               <p>In particular, the aſſaults of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan are either againſt our faith, or elſe againſt godlineſſe in our life; firſt of the former.</p>
               <p>HOw many having diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, he preſſeth down the weake faith of new-borne Chriſtians, appeareth by that which our Saviour ſaith to <hi>Peter, Luke</hi> 22.31.</p>

And if through negligence we doe fall, we muſt not lie ſtill in hardneſſe of heart, but returne to him as to our Father, and hee will heale us: and though wee cannot preſently have that confidence which ſometimes wee have had, yet let us returne, though with ſome ſhamefaſtneſſe, even ſtanding afarre off, with the Iſraelites, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.8.10.</p>
               <p>THe ſecond ſpeciall Let ariſing from want, is, the leaving of our firſt love: for at our firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, when the exceeding love of God in Chriſt is ſhed abroad in our hearts, ſo as it maketh our ſelves admire; this conſtraineth us to love him againe moſt fervently and dearely; his Word and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, with all our brethren, moſt ſenſibly and heartily: and this in Scripture is called our firſt love, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.4.</p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:15946:102"/>
               <p>Now, when this ſhall wax cold through dulneſſe, ſlothfulneſſe, and forgetfulneſſe, &amp;. it muſt need be a hainous thing in the ſight of God, who looketh that our works ſhould be more at the laſt than at the firſt, as our knowledge is more, and experience greater, <hi>Rev</hi> 2.21. Yet this commeth oft to paſſe both in Miniſters and people, to their great ſhame, though otherwiſe they keepe ſome courſe in ſerving God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2. which they ſhew by wearineſſe, or at leaſt wiſe, little pleaſure taking in the publike M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, neglect of private prayer, conference, Mutuall exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. untowardneſſe in good workes, abating of their love to the brethren, imbracing the world, entertaining of ill-companiſhip, with heart-burning againſt the Miniſters that tell them the truth. By theſe and ſuch like ſignes, many doe ſhew how much they have loſt their firſt love, whereby they give great occaſion
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:15946:103"/> of diſcouragement to the weake, and of lamenting to the beſt.</p>
               <p>This was fore-told by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.12. where alſo hee ſhewed how hard it is to keepe, and harder to recover our firſt love. Thirdly, admoniſhing all ſound hearted Chriſtians to looke heedfully, and carefully to nouriſh and preſerve that holy, pure, and firſt ſpark of grace kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in them, againſt all that may come in the way, to quench and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THe third let of this kinde, is, the want of an ordinary and ſound Miniſtery of the Word of God, whereby the way to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and godlineſſe is plainly an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This is the light of the world, and the Sunne which warmeth all the creatures of the earth with his influence; ſo that thoſe which enjoy it not, muſt needes be as the ſhadowed places, which either bring forth nothing, or that which is ſowre and unſavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. How the Divell hath laboured in all ages and Nations, to hinder the paſſage of this Goſpell, may eaſily be perceived, if wee peruſe well the Acts of the Apoſtles, and other Hiſtories of the Church: how he doth prevaile, our owne eyes and eares can witneſſe: The remedy therefore is for ſuch as want, to relieve themſelves with it, where they may with moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency enjoy it, and to ſue ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, that they may live under it, (which ſhould be more generally granted of God, if by fervent prayers and other Chriſtian indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:15946:104"/> it were ſought for.) When they doe enjoy it, then muſt they prize it above all that they have, or ever can enjoy in this world; for thoſe which eſteeme lightly of it, muſt heare what the Scripture ſpeaketh of them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.11.12. <hi>Amos</hi> 8.11.12.</p>

               <p>THe ſecond kinde of generall Lets are, the unmortified af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections wherewith believers are oppreſſed.

               <p>In particular, one kinde is feare and doubt of perſevering by means of afflictions, &amp;c. This doth eaſily take hold of weake ones; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scripture fore-warneth of it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10 28. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.28. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.33.</p>

               <p>The remedie is laid downe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. and 4.1. <hi>Pſal</hi> 119 12. We muſt diligently examine and conſider our waies, till wee have found out our ſinnes

Thus many are caught upon the ſudden, which at other times could eaſily withſtand greater provocations, as we may ſee of <hi>David,</hi> if wee compare 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.7. with 25.13.</p>
               <p>This is a high offence to God, a needleſſe trouble to our ſelves, a bereaving us of godly wiſdome, yea, and of common reaſon alſo.</p>

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:15946:106"/> ſhunned; as unjuſt anger, heart-burnings, looſeneſſe and lightneſſe of heart, raſhneſſe, haſtineſſe, lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhneſſe, and melancholy, with divers ſuch like; the beginning and firſt riſing whereof, although our owne hearts doe breed, yet the ſtrength of them is of Satan.</p>
               <p>BEſides the fore-named evill affections, there are other worldly luſts, wherby many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are much diſguiſed, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carnall pleaſure, and inordinate deſire of riches.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, many are drowned in ſenſuality, and the ſottiſh plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the body, ſo that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come even blind and impotent: for when a man giveth his heart liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to deſire ſtollen waters, and to count them ſweete, not caſting them up, and arming himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them as he ought; and giveth his eye leave to feed it ſelfe with vanity, by little and little his prayers become weake, and unable to drive out ſuch ſottiſhneſſe, but it
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:15946:107"/> lodgeth in him, and ſo is made a ſlave unto it. An example we have of <hi>Sampſon, Judg.</hi> 15. Nay, ſome goe ſo farre, that they are ſenſleſſe at the ſight of it, when as they ſhould tremble to behold in what ſtate they are: for their prayers are dead, their burthen of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence importable, their loſſe of grace unſpeakeable, the griefes of the godly unutterable, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves become as fooles in Iſrael, and ſpectacles to the prophane world to move paſtime.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſt, for the avoiding of theſe miſchiefes; we muſt make it our greateſt care to abide in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, and hold faſt the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of it from day to day.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Wee muſt be willing to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our ſelves to the yoake of Chriſt.</p>

               <p>THe other worldly luſt is noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome care about the things of this life, which is a common evill under the Sunne; for it creepeth upon men ſo ſecretly and ſubtly, that hardly ſhall one perceive the danger of it untill wee have taken hurt by it: yet the danger is dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for where worldlineſſe faſtneth upon a man, it devoureth godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as if there had been none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; it ſuffereth no good thing to grow by it, but choaketh it, and overſhadoweth any gift of God whatſoever, and ſo changeth even good men, that they are not aware of it, that they become moſt unlike themſelves, 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 6.10.</p>
               <p>By this, men in worldly dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings become greedy of profit, raſh
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:15946:108"/> in making, and careleſſe in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of covenants; too much looſeneſſe, earthly rejoycing, and fretting when we thrive not; over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying our ſelves with worldly dealings, ſo that no time is fit for better uſes.</p>
               <p>For the redreſſing of this, foure things are required:</p>
               <p n="1">1 Let every man looke careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that no man be hurt, or ſuſtaine any loſſe or danger by him, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.6. by this he ſhall be freed from all the ſins againſt our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, commanded in the eighth Commandement.</p>

               <p>As for the poore, they ſhall beſt teſtifie that they are not tainted with this ſinne, if they hold faſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie, contentation, and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving. Reaſons to move us to the avoiding of covetouſneſſe, are,</p>

               <p>THere is a third kinde of lets, whereby many beleevers are

Yet are by Satan and our owne corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, made occaſions of impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, fretting, penſiveneſſe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other evils; againſt which we muſt arme our ſelves before they come, that then our unruly paſſions may not break out ſo impatiently, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.33.</p>
               <p n="2">2 So in proſperity he ſubtilly maketh drunken our hearts with love of our good, puffes them up with pride and high mindedneſſe, &amp;c</p>
               <p>To theſe dangerous evils ſhall the godly themſelves bee drawne, except they carefully prevent them.</p>
               <p>It is therefore a ſpeciall point of
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:15946:109"/> wiſedome, in time of peace that we beware that wee leane not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on outward things, for then wee ſhall eaſily bee caſt downe with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very blaſt of adverſity.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Another occaſion of unſetling our hearts are houſhold affaires, and things that concerne our main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, by the unwarie uſe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, men become unquiet, way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, diſtracted, and unlike Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
               <p>A wiſe man therefore will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burden himſelfe of theſe multitude of worldly dealings, which wil not ſuffer the minde to bee freed, and will ſo ſubdue his affections, that he may have them in order as well in one thing as in another.</p>

               <p>Theſe are either ſuch as are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us in this life to be enjoyed for our encouragement, or elſe thoſe which God hath in ſtore for us in the life to come.</p>

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:15946:120"/> or fooliſhly in afflictions, they will turne to our great hurt and vexation: but if wee mingle that Scripture with faith, it will cauſe us to receive all croſſes from God as ſent in love; not to murmur at them, but thankefully and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, and alſo with examination of our ſelves, if ſo bee that any ſin hath brought evill upon us; and then we ſhall have proofe of Gods grace in us, experience of his favor towards us, preſervation from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſins, increaſe of humiliation and thankfulneſſe, preparation for the bearing of greater, with ſome comfort at leaſt in the end, and hope in the midſt, which ſhall not make us aſhamed. When we finde not this doctrine ſavorie and ſweet to us, nor the uſe of it in our affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, let us not charge or chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the Lord for it, but conſider what we have loſt by unbeleefe.</p>
               <p>NOw beſides all the former priviledges ſeverally, there is one that reſpecteth them all of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:15946:120"/> great price, and that is, increaſe and growing of all thoſe graces: for God giveth to his greater every way, than they would have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times either expected or asked, <hi>Col</hi> 1.9.</p>
               <p>An example whereof we may ſee in <hi>Moſes,</hi> if we compare his later times with his former, and in the Apoſtles. This priviledg, if it be duly conſidered, addeth great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and yeeldeth much comfort to Gods children: when they ſhall know that this grace is offered them of God, even that like plants they ſhould grow and increaſe in Gods Houſe, and as the Sunne they ſhould ſhine more and more untill Midday.</p>
               <p>And howſoever the Divell ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth many occaſions of fainting, ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:15946:121"/>
               <p>AS hee that maketh a good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, ſhall increaſe &amp; grow in goodneſſe, ſo he that increaſeth daily, ſhall make a good end at length: for all true believers ſhall continue to the end in a good and godly courſe, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 37.37. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6, <hi>Ioh</hi> 6.39. &amp; 10.28. which as in it ſelfe it is a great priviledge, ſo is it the greater in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This is a treaſure invaluable, mightily reviving &amp; gladding the hearts of Gods children, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging them with cheerfulneſſe to follow the godly life, and all meanes of proceeding in it. For they which take occaſion from this doctrine to waxe ſlothfull, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, idle, vaine, &amp;c. they know not what it meaneth, but pervert that which they know not, to their owne deſtruction.</p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:15946:121"/>
               <p>The truth and certainty of this priviledge is not to be doubted of, though wee ſee good men at their death to ſhew ſmall tokens of grace and of a happy departure: for there may be many impediments, and howſoever it may ſeeme, yet this is certaine, of a good life com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a good death, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 37.37. Sometime indeed for correction of ſome ſin, or for example, the Lord may ſend ſuch a death as is leſſe comfortable, as in <hi>Ioſia,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13.24. and in the Prophet that was ſent to <hi>Ieroboam:</hi> yea, ſometimes a good Chriſtian may offer violence to himſelfe, not knowing what he doth; yet being formerly of a holy and unrebukeable converſation, he is not to be judged according to that one action, how unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and dangerous ſoever in it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Much leſſe ought perſecution to ſeeme ſo grievous, as that it could not ſtand with a good eſtate, and finall perſeverance, eſpecially ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we have much incouragement
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:15946:122"/> to the ſuffering of it, by examples, promiſes, and predictions in holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>This perſeverance then being ſo precious, and yet ſo certaine, let us then nouriſh the hope of it in our ſelves daily by keeping in us a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe to die.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, by holding faſt our rejoycing in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.31. by mortifying of ſin, and keeping our hearts from the love of it, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5.</p>

               <p>NOw that whereon all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer doe depend, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at they aime, is the unſpeakeable glory which was prepared for us before the begi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This for our capacity is ſhadowed out by many earthly compariſons and reſemblances of thoſe things which doe moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light us, as honour, treaſure, riches, beauty, friends, pleaſure, joy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Our company there ſhall be Chriſt, with his holy Angells, bleſſed Apoſtles, Prophets, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, Confeſſors, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The habitation it ſelfe is perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and everlaſting, and ſo are all the treaſures that are enjoyed therein.</p>
               <p>The eſtate of Princes is not to be compared with that happineſſe. All the glory which was in this world, even before the fall, was but a ſhadow in reſpect of this; the glorious and unſpeakeable joy which Gods children h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:15946:123"/> ſhall be wiped from our eyes; for ſin and death ſhall be no more.</p>
               <p>This priviledge added unto all the former doth ſufficient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the happy condition of Gods children, eſpecially to thoſe that know theſe things to belong to themſelves, and find the comfort of them. But this effectuall Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods will, to apprehend them by faith in particular, is a particular gift of God to his Elect; not enjoyed of any other, no not of the greateſt and moſt judiciall Clarkes and Divines, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.11. which doth indeed make this gift more precious, in that Gods children have grace to draw down all good from God in his promiſe; which naturall men cannot doe; for fleſh and blood giveth not this to any. But God draweth his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to the knowing and believing of it: Firſt by his Word, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly by their owne experience, which bringeth moſt neere and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar communion with God by
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:15946:123"/> his Spirit, from whence ſpringeth moſt unſpeakeable joy.</p>
               <p>THeſe being the great Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which our God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for his, and called them to partake of; moſt lamentable it is that many ſhould be ſo ignorant as not to deſire to know them, ſo careleſſe as to reject them, ſo obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate as to tread them under foote, and ſo to leade a life full of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for want of them.</p>
               <p>The Chriſtian life is termed in Scripture, a pilgrimage, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>
                  </label> a ſowing in teares, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Therefore we had need of, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> nay therfore we have theſe priviledges; for otherwiſe wee could never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe the tribulation which wee ſhall meete with; and the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do rather increaſe than dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh their happineſſe.</p>
               <p>We ſee no ſuch glorious things in Chriſtians. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>
                  </label>

               <p>Theſe are ſpirituall things, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> and therfore not eaſily diſcerned being eſpecially inward; beſides, wicked
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:15946:124"/> men will not acknowledge that glory which they ſee; becauſe it reproveth them.</p>
               <p>Againe, theſe priviledges are more inward feeling than out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance. Moreover there are many infirmities in the lives of profeſſours, which the world doe more gaze upon, than upon their Chriſtian converſation otherwiſe. But yet their lives be glorious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and ſhining lights to them that can ſee and diſcerne, whileſt they that carpe at them ſhall be moſt loathſome and abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable.</p>
               <p>AGainſt the former Directions many things may be objected both by carnall cavellers, and alſo by weake Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Of the firſt ſort is, that there needeth no other directions to bee preſcribed beſides Gods word. To which there needeth no other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, but that by the ſame reaſon all preaching were needleſſe; which if it bee as it ſhould, is out of the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:15946:124"/> Scriptures: but beſides there is great need of ſuch a Direction as this to be penned, by reaſon of the great weakeneſſes which are in Chriſtians, ſome being ſlow of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie, others ſhort of memorie, others very ſoone unſetled for want of good direction, are aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med or unwilling to open their griefes, or elſe have no fit man to ſhew them unto: ſo that beſides other great harme which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the want of direction, they are deprived of much communion with the Lord, and comfort that ariſeth from it.</p>
               <p>IT is further objected; that no ſuch direction can bee obſerved daily.</p>
               <p>But if it were impoſſible, why doth the Prophet call them bleſſed that follow ſuch a courſe? <hi>Pſa.</hi> 1.2. and affirme ſo much of himſelfe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.97. many ſuch examples alſo wee have amongſt us, even in this age, who doe not make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:15946:125"/> ſtrangers unto God, to heare from him, or to ſend vnto him now and then; but to walke with him daily, as all are commanded to doe. Nay, many there are, who of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience have found this way not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſible, but eaſie to them, and full of comfort; who ſhould indeed be patternes unto others; for the beſt practiſers are the beſt teachers: neither can any idle profeſſour looke for ſuch eaſe and comfort as the painfull Chriſtian that hath beene taught by long experience. IT will be ſaid, that howſoever it be poſſible, yet it is very toyle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and inconvenient, depriving men of pleaſure, and hindering la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
               <p>But the truth is, there is no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or comfort in the world, like unto it: that is the ſentence of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 119.99, 100. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.11. Neither is this meant of ſerving God at times, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, even all the day long, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119, 10.23.97.</p>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:15946:125"/>
               <p>And whoſoever hath any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and experience by practice, what reward there is in ſerving God, doth juſtifie this to be true: for why alſo ſhould ſo many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians part with all ſinfull pleaſures which they might enjoy with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and ſpend ſo much time and paines in Gods ſervice, if it were ſo irkeſome?</p>
               <p>It is not indeed a pleaſure to all; but to the upright in heart, it is the onely delight, though in this life there be ſome reſiſtance, nay, it ſeaſoneth and ſweatneth all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly liberties, alſo making them truly pleaſant to the godly, which to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are mixed either with bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome tediouſneſſe, or hidden poyſon.</p>
               <p>Neither would this hinder la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and thrift; for all godly thrift, Chriſtian gaining; and lawfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpering in the world, doth ariſe from hence; even when a man go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the workes of his calling with a minde at peace with God,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:15946:126"/> commending his affaires to Gods providence, aimes at his glory, lookes at his promiſe, and ſo waits for a bleſſing: and for want of this, many in great toile and paines find no ſucceſſe nor bleſſing of God; and others that ſeeme to proſper have their wealth but as <hi>Iudas</hi> had his ſop, and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> their quailes, to become their bane and poyſon.</p>
               <p>AS cauſeleſſe alſo is their feare, who ſay, that the following of this direction would breake off all ſociety and fellowſhip amongſt men. For this would breake off none but evill fellowſhip, ſuch as it were to be wiſhed were abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all ſocieties of Chriſtians; which if it ſeeme ſtrange, it will be onely to ſuch as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh of in his firſt Epiſtle, 4.4.</p>
               <p>BUt it is fit to ſatisfie the doubts which weake Chriſtians are like to propound.</p>
               <p>As firſt, how they may attaine
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:15946:126"/> and keepe this Courſe?</p>
               <p>For the anſwer whereof, thus much:</p>
               <p n="1">1 There muſt bee an earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire wrought by the conſideration of the neceſſitie of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2 There muſt bee a ſtrife againſt untowardneſſe and ſloth.</p>
               <p n="3">3 All earthly affections muſt be moderated, and not clog us.</p>
               <p n="4">4 There muſt in faith be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of fruit farer above the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
               <p n="5">5 It will be good at the firſt that doubts which ariſe be imparted to others of experience; and that the proceeding be marked, that wants may be ſupplied, and good things continued.</p>
               <p>This if wee doe, the matter will not ſeeme ſo difficult and tedious unto us; neither are lawfull callings any lets unto this Chriſtian courſe. For holy exerciſes and lawfull bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, a heavenly mind and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dealing, may very well ſtand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:15946:127"/>
               <p>SOme are alſo moved, with the croſſes that they ſhall meete withall in the world.</p>
               <p>But they neede not be troubled ſo as to goe backe, but rather to ſet forward thereby, <hi>Deut.</hi> 82. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.33.</p>
               <p>The end of all this is, that ſuch as have received the Goſpell, and that have not beene carefull thus daily and perpetually to walke with God; if it was of ignorance, they muſt not be diſcouraged, but onely ſhew that ignorance was the cauſe, by amending now upon knowledge. If it was of evill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience againſt their knowledge, their ſin is the greater, eſpecially if they have fallen from the firſt love: Therefore time it is, that they ſhould returne and ſeeke peace with God, maintaining the ſame by carefull watching over themſelves throughout the day, that they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend in nothing.</p>
